1.  **Typography**: Update `layout.tsx` to load Google Fonts (Cormorant Garamond, Space Mono).
2.  **Layout**: Create a `Sidebar` component and update `page.tsx` or `layout.tsx` to include it.
3.  **City Search**: Create a `CityPicker` component (with mock data or simple fetch) to replace Lat/Lon inputs.
4.  **Chart Interactions**: Update `CandleChart` to handle `subscribeCrosshairMove` or `subscribeClick`.
5.  **Details Panel**: Create a `DetailPanel` component that shows when a chart node is clicked.
6.  **Aesthetics**: Apply the "High Contrast" CSS variables and utility classes.
7.  **Verify**: Ensure the "Generate" flow still works with the new components.
