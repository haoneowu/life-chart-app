Pairing principle: High contrast = interesting. Display + monospace, serif + geometric sans, variable font across weights.

Use extremes: 100/200 weight vs 800/900, not 400 vs 600. Size jumps of 3x+, not 1.5x.

Pick one distinctive font, use it decisively. Load from Google Fonts.

<always_add_interactions>
Awesome animation & interactions is key to great design
Think of 3 interaction animations we can add to make the page unique, e.g. scrolling, cursor, hovering interaction
Never use boring & standard animation or interactions, use complex and surprising interactions you saw from best designers
on framer, webflow, dribbble.
